Tasks: During this time I tidied up loopback to print just the JSON string. I started the login & content pages. I completed the login & validation, redirects to login with necessary session destroy using a logout.php intermediary, and links between content1 and content2. Need to encapuslate content pages with session/redirect to login.

Tasks: multtable validates to pos integers; loopback debugged to work with Post; login, content1, content2 redirects if not logged in, and destroys session with GET at login page (removed logout)
